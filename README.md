Waffle's Optimization is a modpack designed to provide a more immersive experience than other modpacks offer, although if you are looking for performance take a look at modpacks like [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop) or [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive), this modpack brings most of the features of optifine.

## Features
+ ### Waffle's Optimization Features
  - Completely redesigned key combination mapping
  - Minimalist effects bar
  - Now you can put texture packs, data and servers from within the game (without having to open .minecraft)
  - Falling leaves!!!
  - Now you can see the protection of each armor in the protection bar
  - Now you can view the hunger bar in detail

+ ### Additive Features

  Additive is designed as an open-source and modular alternative to OptiFine, offering many of the same features, including but not limited to:

  - Large performance boost
  - OptiFine resource pack features
  - Shader packs
  - Dynamic lighting
  - Better grass and snow
  - OF donator capes (and [free capes](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive/wiki/Supporter-cape))
  - Many other key OptiFine features

  You can check the intergrav website to see all the Additive features [here](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive/wiki/Give-up-OptiFine).

  ### Other Features

  Additive contains a very small amount of non-OptiFine features - mainly being small fixes, such as [EmuNO](https://modrinth.com/mod/emuno) and [Fix Keyboard on Linux](https://modrinth.com/mod/fix-keyboard-on-linux). There's also [World Host](https://modrinth.com/mod/world-host) included, which lets you host your world to the public by simply clicking "Open Externally" in the pause menu. [Borderless Mining](https://modrinth.com/mod/borderless-mining) is tucked away for convenience, disabled by default, but you can enable it in the mod menu. For the full list, check out the [Extra features](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive/wiki/Extra-features) wiki page. (Addtive wiki page)
